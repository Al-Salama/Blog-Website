                                While some car fires are caused by collisions, they are more often caused by problems with a
                                vehicle's electrical
                                wiring, fuel system or even cigarettes left in the car, leaving the engine to catch
                                fire. Your best line of defense is to have these systems checked out at every service
                                call.

                        </a> recommends following these steps if you're driving and a fire starts:
                    </p>

                    <ul class="list">
                        <li>
                            Signal and immediately move to the closest safe place to stop, whether that's a side lane or
                            a median.
                        </li>

                        <li>Stop the car and turn off the ignition.</li>

                        <li>
                            Get every person out of the car and don't allow anyone to go back to retrieve personal
                            items.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            Move far from the burning vehicle to avoid the flames and toxic fumes — at least 100 feet —
                            and also keep bystanders back.
                        </li>

                        <li>Call 911.</li>

                        <li>Alert oncoming traffic if possible.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p class="article-piece">
                        Recognize that car fires can break out in places other than the engine compartment. They can
                        also occur under the vehicle, near the wheels and brakes, in your dashboard and even inside the
                        car. In fact, interior fires can be among the most frightening because of your close proximity
                        to the flames, fumes and smoke.
                    </p>

                    <div class="article-piece">
                        It's generally not recommended that you try to put out the fire yourself. Opening the hood or
                        car doors increases the air supply and may accelerate the fire.
                    </div>

                    <div class="article-piece">
                        Once the fire has been put out, you may wonder if insurance covers a car fire. You will need to
                        contact your insurance agent. If possible, take photos of the damage and collect the names and
                        phone numbers of witnesses. Ask the firefighters when and if it is safe to remove personal items
                        from the vehicle. Contact your insurance company to have the vehicle towed for an inspection
                        before attempting to operate it again. If your car has been damaged and the potential repair
                        costs exceed the value of the car, your insurance company might consider it a total loss. You
                        will need to contact your insurance agent and most likely file a claim.
