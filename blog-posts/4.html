                                Sometimes, we have to fall back on an arsenal of conversation starters. It helps to
                                spark a discussion, even when it's taking every ounce of willpower you have not to go
                                home, turn on Netflix, and order sushi.

                    <ol class="list">
                        <li class="list-section">
                            <h2>"Hi, I'm 'X.'"</h2>
                            <p class="article-piece">
                                It actually works. Just be sure you have something to follow your introduction, so that you
                                don't end up staring at each other in silence. And as you'll see, that's the key to most
                                conversation starters — be ready with a follow-up. Saying "hi" is just your way to get the
                                ball rolling, so be sure you can keep the exchange going and take it to the next level.
                            </p>

                            <p class="article-piece">
                                (Note: Use your first name, instead of "X.")
                            </p>
                        </li>


                        <li class="list-section">
                            <h2>"Are you having issues with the Wi-Fi?"</h2>
                            <p class="article-piece">
                                Good news: The answer is almost always "yes." Plus, I don't know about you, but I think we
                                all have war stories of when the internet stopped working for us at the worst time — those
                                are always great conversation starters.
                            </p>
                        </li>


                        <li class="list-section">
                            <h2>"That [food or beverage] looks great. Where did you find it?"</h2>
                            <p class="article-piece">
                                This question can offer a few different answers. The person might just tell you where they
                                got it, or they could go into a description or a comment on the quality. Not sure where to
                                go from there? Tell them about a place where you once had the best version of whatever
                                they're drinking or snacking on. But frame it as a question — "Have you ever been to Hawaii?
                                I once had the best fish tacos there."
                            </p>

                            <p class="article-piece">
                                This technique also works with neutral compliments, like telling someone that you love their
                                laptop bag or jacket. Most people enjoy receiving positive feedback, and will probably
                                follow up with a story about where or how they got it. (And if they don't follow up, ask
                                them about it — remember, keep the conversation going.)
                            </p>
                        </li>


                        <li class="list-section">
                            <h2>"Do you know if there's a coat check?"</h2>
                            <p class="article-piece">
                                I always like to leverage the communal confusion that occurs at every event. When you first
                                arrive, no one really knows what they're doing. But anyone who does will jump at the chance
                                to be "in the know."
                            </p>
                        </li>


                        <li class="list-section">
                            <h2>"I can't believe how cold/hot/beautiful it is today."</h2>
                            <p class="article-piece">
                                Talking about the weather sounds so cliché, but it actually works — especially if people are
                                visiting from out of town. Maybe someone from sunny California, for example, is traveling to
                                Boston for INBOUND this year. Of course, that would require you to ask the person where
                                they're from, first. But once you have an answer, you can even make a joke about it — "Boy,
                                I bet you're glad you left Los Angeles behind for a few days of chilly New England weather."
                            </p>
                        </li>


                        <li class="list-section">
                            <h2>"Are you here with colleagues?"</h2>
                            <p class="article-piece">
                                If someone you're speaking with is at the event with a group of people, that can allow your
                                circle to expand — if you're proactive about it. You can tactfully express interest in
                                meeting someone's co-worker by asking what the different roles are on that person's team,
                                and responding with something like, "You know, I've always wanted to learn more about X.
                                Would you mind introducing me to your colleague who works on that?"
                            </p>

                            <p class="article-piece">
                                But if that person is flying solo, you can generate some empathy as a fellow lone wolf. That
                                doesn't mean you should cling to that person the entire time, but a "me, too" is always
                                nice. Just be sure not to leave it at that — follow up with an idea of where to meet some of
                                your fellow cohorts, like mentioning that there's supposed to be a great breakout session
                                later.
                            </p>
                        </li>


                        <li class="list-section">
                            <h2>
                                "You guys look like you're having the most fun over here. Mind if I join this
                                conversation?"
                            </h2>
                            <p class="article-piece">
                                Of course, you'll probably want to say that to people who actually look like they're having
                                a good time. And really, who's going to say "no" to that? If they do, chances are, you'll
                                want to find another group to hang out with, anyway.
                            </p>
                        </li>


                        <li class="list-section">
                            <h2>"Are you here to see anyone in particular?"</h2>
                            <p class="article-piece">
                                If you're both interested in meeting the same people or seeing the same sessions, this
                                question will help you establish that common ground. Regardless of the answer, you'll learn
                                more about each others' goals and reasons for attending the event, which promotes an
                                exchange of ideas and knowledge. And that can create opportunities, even after the event is
                                over — you never know when that person might need your expertise down the line, or
                                vice-versa.
                            </p>
                        </li>


                        <li class="list-section">
                            <h2>"Did you all come here together, or did you meet here?"</h2>
                            <p class="article-piece">
                                This question is a great one when you've joined a group of strangers. It also opens up the
                                conversation to everyone in the group, instead of limiting it to the people sitting right
                                next to you. And the more people chatting, the better — it's another opportunity for you to
                                learn about everyone's goals and exchange ideas.
                            </p>
                        </li>


                        <li class="list-section">
                            <h2>"Well, while we're here, I might as well introduce myself."</h2>
                            <p class="article-piece">
                                If the event is big enough, chances are that you'll have to wait in line for something — a
                                keynote, the restroom, or food, to name a few. And, as the least patient person on the
                                planet, I can attest to the effectiveness of using that time to do something other than
                                focusing on how slowly the line is moving. Put that energy toward something productive, like
                                meeting the people around you.
                            </p>
                        </li>


                        <li class="list-section">
                            <h2>"Did you hear X speak?"</h2>
                            <p class="article-piece">
                                Being at the same conference, sessions and speakers are guaranteed common ground, so use
                                that to your advantage. It's a great starting point that can go in a lot of different
                                conversational directions — did you see that person speak at a different event? Did you read
                                their work? What did you think of the talk?
                            </p>
                        </li>


                        <li class="list-section">
                            <h2>"Have you ever been to X down the street? I've really wanted to check it out."</h2>
                            <p class="article-piece">
                                This question is a great one when you're attending an out-of-town event. If there's a
                                restaurant there that you've heard good things about, you can ask locals and visitors alike
                                if they want to check it out, too.
                            </p>

                            <p class="article-piece">
                                And if you're a local yourself, and you're chatting with visitors, you can recommend that
                                they see the place while they're in town. Mention that you haven't been there in a while, or
                                that you'd love to go back. If there's a shared interest in going, you can suggest heading
                                over together or sharing a cab.
                            </p>

                            <p class="article-piece">
                                But if they're not interested in going to that particular venue, ask them if they can
                                recommend where to go, or if there's another place they wanted to check out. You could
                                suggest heading there together, too, but make sure you're not being too pushy — sometimes,
                                people really just want to take a break to be alone, so don't take it personally.
                            </p>

                            <p class="article-piece">
                                Be sure to have a quick follow-up if the answer is "no" — like asking if any of that
                                person's colleagues are speaking, or which sessions they plan on attending. Questions like
                                that can prime you to learn more about what the person does, and how you might be able to
                                learn from each other.
                            </p>

                                But if the answer is yes — jackpot. That's a great opportunity to ask them what they're
                                speaking about, and what made them so interested in the topic. And be sure to mention you're
                                looking forward to attending, and what you hope to learn from it.
                            </p>

                                And if that person already spoke, but you missed it — "Bummer," you can tell them. Just be
                                sure to ask if there's somewhere you'll be able to watch it online, or when their next
                                speaking engagement is.

                                If the answer is "yes," use that to make the person feel like an expert, without
                                overwhelming them. Ask them for insider tips on how to make the most of the event, what was
                                different about it last year, and what they're hoping to do this year. That can lay the
                                groundwork for uncovering shared interests.

                                But first-timers can empathize with you, and you can even ask them some of the same
                                questions, like what made them come to the event in the first place and how they're liking
                                it so far. You're still opening up the conversation to a potential "me, too" moment, and
                                might find an opportunity to participate in a session together.

                                This question creates a great opportunity to start chatting with some of the people who were
                                sitting next to you during a session, instead of silently/awkwardly shuffling out when it's
                                over. If you legitimately didn't understand something, don't be embarrassed — it might have
                                confused other people, too. Brainstorming different interpretations of a talk can actually
                                be kind of fun — it gives you a chance to be creative and possibly share ideas with someone
                                who has a fresh perspective.

                                And even if that person did understand what was confusing you, asking them to explain it
                                might accomplish a little bit of ego-stroking. But keep the conversation going — especially
                                if you actually want to learn more about what that person has to say.

                                This one is a spinoff of a pickup line from comedian Pete Holmes' podcast. His original
                                version was, "I'm tired of talking to my friends, what are you guys talking about?"

                                It's a line that's effective in a number of scenarios, because it's most likely true. It's
                                not that you don't like your colleagues — but as long as you're surrounded by new people,
                                why not gain some of that fresh perspective I mentioned earlier? It shows an interest in
                                getting to know the folks who are there, and sets the tone for you to exchange funny office
                                stories, which is always a great icebreaker with someone unfamiliar.
